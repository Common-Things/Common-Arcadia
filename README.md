List of Fabric mods I approve and use everyday

*Mods are updated to the latest minecraft release, actual version of the repo : `1.18.2`*

## Suggest mods
If you wanna contribute to this list, just make a PR with the mod file or link (I prefere the second option), only curseforge, modrinth and reliable github pages are allowed and accepted.
