### Description
Common-Sense is an optimization and user-friendly modpack purposing a whole new experience of vanilla gameplay
>Mate, it's almost 120 mods in there and you dare call it vanilla üôÑ


Now based on [Fabulously Optimized](https://modrinth.com/modpack/fabulously-optimized), Common-Sense will also try to make you discover new little mods that add great features such as:
- Cosmetics with [Cosmetica](https://modrinth.com/mod/cosmetica/)
- Great quality ambient effects with [Effective](https://github.com/Ladysnake/Effective) (Will come back soon!)
- QOL utility mods such as [Xaero's World Map](https://chocolateminecraft.com/worldmap.php) and [Xaero's Minimap](https://chocolateminecraft.com/minimap2.php)

Feel free to report any bug to the creator¬π, even for the most awkward question, there are no dumb questions as long as it makes sense to ask!

Even if this is a little modpack, all your suggestions for embellishing the page/improve the pack are also welcome ^^

Pro Tips : It is better to play without resourcepacks, you may enjoy better both shaders and visual effects
